I've been having a blog on and off for quite some time now.

My first blog was hosted on bloger.com even before the Google acquisition and I was quite active back then. It wasn't tech related back then; I would write about some new film I had watched, the latest on teenage drama or just pure nonsense.

As my interest on web development grew, I started to build my own website. There was a Portuguese hosting service that would allow you to host websites for free, but you couldn't run any server-side code, just serving static files.

In the beginning, I felt like a wizard! I spent ages trying to figure out how to build the template I wanted, and I annoyed [my friend Pedro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/557340/My_Friend_Pedro/) with hundreds of CSS questions:

* "How do I put this bit here but with the text like this?"
* "Why aren't these two aligned?"
* "Why is IE looking so different?"
